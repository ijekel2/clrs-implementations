## Algorithms and Data Structure from CLRS Textbook
This repository contains algorithms and data structures from the textbook Introduction to 
Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS). For each chapter I implement
the algorithms in Java and write a simple unit test for each. Due to restrictions in time,
I refrain from implementing certain algorithms that are less relavant to my interests.

### Chapter 2

* Merge Sort
